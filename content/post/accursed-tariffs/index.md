I've been under the weather this week with a bad cold, so I'm a little
out of it and not thinking as clearly as I should be. In other words,
this is the ideal mental state for discussing Trump's tariffs. 

Many electrons have been inconvenienced over this topic, and most have
been in vain. I've wondered all week whether I had anything meaningful
to add. However, a few points that have emerged in discussions are
worth highlighting.

[Bill Mitchell has already written an insightful piece][1] on the subject,
making perhaps the most crucial observation:

> The analysis has to be different when there is the possibility of
nominal exchange rate movements coinciding with relative price level
movements between nations.

What's astonishing is how few commentaries, particularly those
originating in the U.S., acknowledge that China operates with
a different currency. [We often see arguments][2] like:

> If a game costs \$10 to make in China, upon arrival in the U.S.,
the publisher must pay a \$5 tax to the U.S. government.

However, the game doesn't cost \$10 to make in China; it costs about
70 CNY.

To offset the tariffs, the exchange rate only needs to shift so that 70
CNY equates to 6.66 USD—a simple adjustment that China could facilitate
by directing its [sovereign wealth funds][3] to be more generous when
purchasing U.S. dollars. The result? China accumulates fewer U.S. dollars,
reducing its savings and, consequently, reducing the issuance of
U.S. Treasuries and interest payments flowing to China. Paradoxically,
this could even shrink the dollar-denominated trade deficit, making
Chinese goods appear even cheaper in U.S. markets—despite no actual
reduction in the volume of imports.

There are, of course, many permutations here, but the basic idea remains
the same. The intent of the US administration is to eliminate additional
net foreign savings of USD.

Trump is resorting to tariffs because they are a tool granted to him by
Congress, and Congress, due to the structure of the U.S. institutional
arrangements, lacks the power to curtail his use of them. Any restrictive
legislation passed would face a presidential veto. Such is the challenge
of having a Head of State with an independent democratic mandate.

However, this approach fails to address the root cause of the issue:
economies pursuing export-led growth manipulate financial flows to
suppress productive activity in their target markets, creating space
for their output. When U.S. dollars are exchanged for CNY, they fuel
wages and production in China, while the corresponding U.S. dollar
holdings in Chinese wealth funds flow into assets, prompting portfolio
adjustments that ultimately end up in U.S. Treasuries—where the funds
effectively disappear. The missing counterbalance? Federal spending should
be directing dollars into domestic production and employment. Without
such a mechanism, imports become an economic burden rather than a benefit
to a good chunk of the population, and political responses like Trump's
tariffs become inevitable.

Much of this boils down to how GDP is calculated, adding exports and
subtracting imports. In contrast, actual living standards are improved
by imports and diminished by exports. This is a textbook example of
Goodhart's Law: 

> When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.

There are far more effective ways to address the impact of trade
imbalances, but those in power have ignored them for years. And so,
here we are—watching events unfold.

Indeed, we live in interesting times. Fittingly, we even blame the
Chinese for that saying.
