In their article ["The new operating
procedures of the Bank of England: A bonanza for the
banks,"](https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/new-operating-procedures-bank-england-bonanza-banks), Paul
De Grauwe and Yuemei Ji propose a two-tier system of reserve requirements
to mitigate large transfers from the Bank of England to commercial banks. While
their analysis highlights significant fiscal implications, it overlooks
critical aspects of the UK's financial framework, particularly the
Debt Management Office's (DMO) role and the mechanics of government
cash management.[^1]

**The Role of the Debt Management Office**

The DMO is an executive agency of HM Treasury responsible for carrying
out the government's debt and cash management policies. Its goals
include minimising financing costs over the long term and managing the
government's cash needs. The DMO achieves this by issuing government
securities, such as Treasury bills and gilts, to finance public borrowing
requirements. These instruments are sold to financial institutions,
including commercial banks, which earn interest on their holdings.

**Interest Payments: A Broader Perspective**

De Grauwe and Ji express concern that paying interest on bank reserves
leads to substantial transfers to banks, potentially reducing the
effectiveness of monetary policy. However, this perspective does not fully
consider that the government routinely pays interest to banks through
various channels, not solely via central bank reserves. For instance,
when the DMO issues daily repos and weekly Treasury bills, it incurs
interest obligations to the purchasers, most of whom are commercial
banks. This practice is a standard aspect of government cash management
and is not typically viewed as problematic.

**The Ways and Means Account: An Alternative?**

The authors do not address the possibility of altering the DMO's cash
management strategy, such as eliminating the issuance of Treasury
bills and instead utilising HM Treasury's Ways and Means account
held at the Bank of England. The Ways and Means account serves as the
government's overdraft facility with the central bank, allowing for
short-term financing needs. Relying on this account would eliminate
interest payments to commercial banks, as the Bank of England would
account for the relevant credits at a zero rate.

If, as De Grauwe and Ji argue, zero-rated reserve tiers do not distort
monetary operations, then using the Ways and Means account should be just
as unproblematic. The logic underpinning their position—and that of the
European Central Bank—implies that reserves held at zero interest do
not create distortions. Therefore, if such an approach is acceptable,
there can be no operational reason for the Ways and Means account to
cause issues. The argument must be internally consistent: De Grauwe and
Ji (and the ECB) are wrong about the effect of zero-rated reserve tiers,
or the conventional fears over using the Ways and Means account have no
logical basis.

**Money Creation and Fiscal Implications**

It's important to clarify that the Bank of England does not create money
when crediting interest on reserves. Instead, it utilises income from
its assets, such as government bonds held in the Asset Purchase Facility
and indemnities received from HM Treasury. Therefore, interest payments
on reserves are ultimately a fiscal expense borne by the government,
as with interest payments on Treasury bills and repos issued by the DMO.

**Consistency in Fiscal Policy**

The critique raises a fundamental question: Why is paying interest
to banks via the DMO's operations considered acceptable, while similar
payments through the Bank of England's reserve remuneration are viewed as
problematic? In the UK, the Bank of England and the DMO operate under the
umbrella of HM Treasury. Consequently, transfers to the banking sector,
whether through debt issuance or reserve remuneration, have comparable
fiscal impacts. If zero-rated reserves are deemed non-disruptive,
then logically, the same must hold for the Ways and Means account. A
comprehensive assessment of these practices should consider the overall
coherence of fiscal and monetary policy rather than isolating specific
mechanisms.

**Conclusion**

While De Grauwe and Ji's proposal for a two-tier reserve requirement
system aims to reduce transfers to banks and enhance monetary policy
effectiveness, it does not fully account for the integrated nature of
the UK's fiscal and monetary operations. Furthermore, their position is
internally inconsistent: if zero-rated reserves do not interfere with
monetary policy, the Ways and Means account should not be considered
problematic either. A holistic approach that considers the roles of the
Bank of England and the DMO and the various channels through which the
government interacts with the banking sector is essential for formulating
effective and consistent policy recommendations.
