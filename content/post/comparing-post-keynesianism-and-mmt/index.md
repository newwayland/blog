## Comparing Post-Keynesianism and Modern Monetary Theory: The Importance of Ontology and Sociology

[Phil Armstrong][2] and [Neil Wilson][3]

[In our new paper][1] we utilise Marc Lavoie’s 2024 critique of
Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) to contrast the ontological foundations,
methodologies, and policy implications of MMT with those of Post-Keynesian
(PK) economics. We argue that disagreements between these schools reflect
fundamental ontological divergences rather than technical nuances.

Post-Keynesian economics models the economy as a private-sector-led
system where the state intervenes reactively, while MMT positions the
state as the constitutive architect of monetary systems, designing
market operations through taxation, currency issuance, and fiscal
policy. Key areas examined include treasury-central bank operations,
external sector dynamics, unemployment, and interest rate policy. The
paper also addresses MMT’s intellectual origins in financial practice
rather than heterodox theory and analyses sociological factors shaping
its contentious reception within economics.

We conclude that constructive MMT-PK dialogue requires acknowledging
these ontological roots to reconcile divergent policy prescriptions.
