Recent headlines have painted an alarmist picture of the UK's debt
situation, rife with half-truths and outdated comparisons. Even
the [ordinarily rational Andrew Neil][1] has succumbed to monetarist
misconceptions, claiming that

> Investors will not take on any more British sovereign debt without a
substantial risk premium

Before drawing flawed parallels between the UK and Germany by comparing
borrowing costs within entirely different currency frameworks.

Meanwhile, [Faisal Islam at the BBC][2] noted that

> Government borrowing costs have hit their highest level in 16 years.

While he offers some context by pointing to the uncertainty of future
U.S. economic policies, his analysis still contributes to the broader
narrative of misplaced panic.

These commentaries fail to grasp the key issue: the current debt
management framework is a relic of outdated policy, ill-suited for the
realities of the modern financial system. It's time to reconsider and
update our approach.

## The Origins of the Current Policy

The UK's current 'full funding' rule dates back to 1985 when it was
introduced to neutralise the public sector's influence on the M4 money
supply.[^9] This framework was solidified by a [1995 review][3] long before
critical developments like Bank of England reserves, interest on those
reserves, and Quantitative Easing (QE) reshaped monetary dynamics. The
rule's foundation—derived from fixed exchange rate thinking and
monetarist orthodoxy—does not reflect the operational reality of the
UK's floating exchange rate regime.

The floating exchange rate fundamentally alters how government spending interacts with a currency
area. When the government spends, in effect [it gives the private sector the money][5] it uses to buy government bonds.
At an aggregate level, in the UK, the choice boils down to holding a
gilt or a Bank of England deposit. There is no other alternative. This
interdependence makes the lifetime price of a gilt a reflection of
expected Bank of England deposit rates over the same period.

Yet, the Debt Management Office (DMO) remains shackled by 1990s thinking,
issuing long-term gilts into a market seeking shorter durations. For
instance, [recent ultra-long gilt sales][6] forced the country to lock
in a 5% running yield on £2.25 billion—higher than the current Bank Rate of
4.75%. This mismatch is costly and entirely avoidable.

## A Call for Policy Modernisation

The DMO should never sell gilts at yields exceeding the Bank
Rate. Instead, it should align its operations dynamically with
any market preferences for shorter maturities, [as determined
by current redemption yields][8]. At a minimum, the government should
adjust the DMO's remit to ensure gilt issuance is always cost-effective
regardless of market conditions.

Moreover, the outdated full-funding rule, grounded in discredited
monetarist beliefs about the M4 money supply, should be scrapped. By
default, HM Treasury should leave deficits on the Ways and Means account
at the Bank of England, paying the Bank Rate. This approach eliminates
redundant cash management processes, saving costs and streamlining
operations.

The DMO's role should shift to reducing this default cost by issuing
gilts and Treasury Bills on tap, priced in line with Office of Budget
Responsibility (OBR) yield curve projections. It should only issue
securities if doing so would be cheaper than the *projected* floating path
alternative, ensuring interest payments on any deficit increase remained
within budget.

## Conclusion

The UK's debt management framework is stuck in the past, constrained
by Thatcher-era monetarist principles that never applied in the first
place. Just as the government recently updated its debt definition from
Public Sector Net Debt to Public Sector Net Financial Liabilities, it
must now overhaul debt management practices to reflect modern monetary
realities. By embracing a more flexible, cost-efficient approach, we
can discard outdated constraints and better support the nation's renewal.

A debt management review is well overdue. Let's make 2025 the year we
move beyond 1990s thinking and embrace a framework that fits today's
economic challenges.
