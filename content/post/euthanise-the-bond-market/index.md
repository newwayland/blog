summary: "The UK gilt market turmoil exposes the bond market as an outdated relic. Far from enforcing fiscal discipline, it serves no public purpose. It's time to modernise public finance and end the myth of 'bond vigilantes'."

---

The bond market has long been hailed as a vital cog in the machinery of
modern economies, a sentinel ensuring fiscal discipline, and a barometer
of economic stability. But is this reputation deserved? Recent turmoil
in the UK gilt market following Rachel Reeves's maiden Budget has
brought this question into sharp focus. A sell-off in gilts has been
framed as the righteous judgment of the "bond vigilantes" sniffing
out fiscal imprudence. Yet, this narrative is built on misunderstandings
and misplaced reverence for an institution that is neither necessary
nor productive.

### The Myths of Market Discipline

Let's break down the received wisdom. We are told that government
borrowing is constrained by the willingness of investors to lend. When
spending and borrowing exceed some implicit threshold of acceptability,
markets "strike back," driving up yields and demanding fiscal
rectitude. According to this view, the UK government's plans to
issue £300bn of gilts this tax year—to cover a deficit augmented by
£32.3bn annually over the next five years—represents a breach of that
threshold. Bond investors, alarmed by a perceived lack of discipline,
have sold off.

None of this is true.

The UK government does not need to "borrow" in any conventional
sense. Spending by the government is an act of money creation. When
the government credits a bank account, the Bank of England records a
corresponding credit and debit on its balance sheet. Taxes operate in
reverse, debiting bank accounts along with a corresponding debit and
credit recorded on the Bank of England balance sheet. The result is a
balancing item in the accounts, which is all 'government borrowing'
really is - occurring as a natural function of double-entry accounting,
not the rapacious whims of financial brigands.

Gilts are not a necessity but a political choice stemming from the
outdated "full funding rule." This policy requires the issuance of bonds
to cover deficits, a remnant of an older economic orthodoxy linked to
the long-defunct gold standard. In reality, these bonds merely offer
investors the option to exchange overnight reserves (which pay the Bank
of England's Bank Rate) for longer-term instruments with a fixed yield.

### The Economics of Parasitism

What function, then, do bond investors serve? Advocates might argue they
provide discipline, ensuring governments use public funds wisely. Yet
this discipline is illusory. The bond yield is simply the market's
expectation of future Bank of England policy rates. Investors do not
"set" borrowing costs; they predict them. The entire bond market's
existence rests on the unnecessary act of swapping one type of government
liability (reserves) for another (gilts).

Far from being the guardians of fiscal virtue, bond investors resemble
the money changers of biblical lore—skimming off the system while
adding no value. Their profits are a deadweight loss to the economy. The
intricate dance of issuance, trading, and yield curve management consumes
resources and employs talent that could be deployed in more productive
sectors. Financial engineers who might design systems to combat climate
change or improve healthcare instead spend their days shaving basis
points off gilt portfolios.

### A Political Choice, Not an Economic Necessity

Ending the bond market is not a radical idea but a logical step toward
modernising public finance. If the UK government were to eliminate the
'full funding' rule, it would continue to settle its obligations
just as it has been doing since the 1860s—by directly crediting bank
accounts. Private banks would receive the Bank Rate on their deposits held
at the Bank of England, and the costly bond issuance process would end.

Critics may raise concerns about inflationary risks or a potential loss of
market discipline, but these fears are unfounded. Inflation is determined
by the balance between aggregate demand and real economic capacity, not
by the actions of bond traders. Ultimately, fiscal "discipline" is
a political choice best exercised through democratic means rather than
being delegated to unelected financial elites.

### Reclaiming Public Purpose

The bond market, far from being an essential institution, is a parasitic
appendage—one that has outlived whatever utility it might once have
had. By continuing to issue gilts, the UK government perpetuates a system
that benefits a narrow class of financial intermediaries at the expense
of the broader public. The talents of those currently employed in the bond
market could be better used in sectors that address real-world challenges.

It is time to euthanise the bond market—not with malice but with a
clear-eyed understanding that its continued existence serves no public
purpose. Just as the money changers were driven from the Temple, so must
we clear out this vestige of an outdated economic paradigm. The myth
of the vigilantes must be dispelled. Only then can we create a monetary
system that serves the needs of everyday people.
