### Why Outdated NHS Pay Rules Are Failing Resident Doctors

The principle of equal pay for equal work is a fundamental aspect of
fairness in the workplace, and it should be upheld in the NHS just as
it is in any other profession. However, a structural issue within NHS
pay systems has resulted in a persistent disparity that undermines
this principle. This situation is not due to individual decisions
but arises from the existence of two conflicting pay frameworks that
operate simultaneously, each shaped by different historical contexts
and philosophies.

According to an [FOI request to the Royal
Devon and Exeter University Healthcare NHS Foundation
Trust](https://www.royaldevon.nhs.uk/media/nyqg43hl/foi-rdf2043-physician-associates-pas.pdf),
the role of a Physician Associate is considered comparable to that of
a Foundation Year 1 or Foundation Year 2 resident doctor, except for
their ability to prescribe medication or order ionising radiation.

Resident doctors are compensated under the Medical and Dental Pay Spine,
a legacy system designed during a time when medical careers followed a
more linear and predictable trajectory. In contrast, Physician Associates,
as the FOI above reveals, are paid at Band 7 under the Agenda for Change
framework, which explicitly accounts for demanding work patterns and
unsociable hours through structured pay enhancements.

As the NHS increasingly relies on multidisciplinary teams, the coexistence
of these two pay structures has led to inequitable outcomes, with
resident doctors often receiving significantly lower compensation than
their colleagues performing comparable roles under different terms.

### A Direct Comparison: The £18,000 Pay Gap

To illustrate this disparity,
we can examine an [example high-intensity hospital
rota](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/typical_rotas/response/1759664/attach/5/BH%2520General%2520Surgery%2520F1%2520Aug%252020.pdf),
worked by a Foundation Year 1 doctor, and compare it with the earnings
of a base of Band 7 physician associate working an identical shift pattern.

A Foundation Year 1 doctor working an average of 46.5 hours per week,
including nights and weekends, earns £44,735.60 annually. A physician
associate on the same rota, paid under Agenda for Change, would earn
£63,033.43, a difference of over £18,000.

This discrepancy arises because Agenda for Change incorporates mechanisms
that more accurately reflect the demands of intensive work patterns. It
provides time-and-a-half overtime pay for hours exceeding 37.5 per week,
alongside percentage-based enhancements for antisocial hours. In contrast,
the resident doctor contract offers no overtime premium, a fixed 37%
night shift supplement, and a weekend allowance based on frequency rather
than actual hours worked.

A similar discrepancy occurs if we do the reverse and place
a FY1 resident doctor on an [example physician associate
rota](https://www.royaldevon.nhs.uk/media/nyqg43hl/foi-rdf2043-physician-associates-pas.pdf).

A Physician Associate working an average of 40.5 hours per week, including
weekends on rota, earns £51,962.65 annually. A resident doctor on the
same rota would earn £38,172.10, a difference of nearly £14,000.

### Training and Responsibilities: Key Distinctions

To assess pay fairness, it is necessary to consider the differences in
training and professional responsibilities between resident doctors and
physician associates.

Resident doctors complete a five-year medical degree, followed by a
two-year foundation programme. The General Medical Council regulates
them and they assume full legal responsibility for clinical decisions,
including prescribing, diagnosing complex cases, and leading patient care.

Physician associates undertake a two-year postgraduate training programme
following an initial honours degree in healthcare or biosciences. While
they contribute valuably to patient care, their scope of practice is
supervised, and they do not hold independent prescribing rights or
ultimate legal responsibility for patient outcomes.

These distinctions do not diminish the importance of either role but
highlight that resident doctors bear greater clinical accountability,
which the NHS should reflect in remuneration.

### The Flawed Argument of Future Earnings

A common rebuttal to concerns about resident doctor pay is that their
earnings will increase substantially as they progress. However, this
argument overlooks the growing barriers to career advancement. Competition
for specialist training posts has intensified, [with 3.7 applicants
per internal medicine training place in 2024, compared to 1.4 in
2019](https://www.rcp.ac.uk/policy-and-campaigns/policy-documents/left-in-the-lurch-royal-college-of-physicians-describes-resident-doctor-recruitment-crisis-in-new-statement/),
despite internal medicine generally being considered one of the least
competitive specialities.

Many resident doctors now spend prolonged periods in lower-paid jobs
without the pay progression and job security available to peers in other
NHS roles. Their lives are left on hold, moving from one fixed-term
annual contract to the next.

This situation has come about due to the usual UK government
fix to everything: take from the rest of the world rather
than building here. There has been a massive increase in
the number of medical graduates arriving from abroad. Unlike
other nations, [the UK does not prioritise its graduates for speciality
training](https://www.bmj.com/careers/article/a-guide-to-img-applications-for-specialty-training-in-the-uk),
a stance that has attracted criticism, [including letters to the
BMJ](https://www.bmj.com/content/389/bmj.r1023/rr). As
the [GMC workforce report
states](https://www.gmc-uk.org/-/media/documents/somep-workforce-report-2024-full-report_pdf-109169408.pdf),
"Given that non-UK graduates are increasingly entering postgraduate
training and that each year has a new cohort of doctors applying to
postgraduate training for the first time, there are questions on whether
the UK's training systems have the capacity to train all the doctors
who want to enter".

The UK government's response has been to try
to put out the fire with a pipette, promising [a meagre 333 places per
year](https://www.hee.nhs.uk/our-work/doctors-training/addressing-health-inequalities-distribution-medical-specialty-training-programme/frequently-asked-questions-faq/expansion-0)
over three years, funded for one cycle. Yet [GMC research
reports](https://www.gmc-uk.org/-/media/documents/final-report-postuk-medreview_pdf-101155712.pdf)
\[Figure 5\] that 1047 doctors completing foundation training deferred a
year due to 'logistical' issues (including failure to secure a training
post), a figure underlined by [the Foundation Programme indicative
survey](https://foundationprogramme.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/UKFP-2024-F2-Career-Destination-Survey-Report.pdf)
\[Table 5\] which reports 23.8% of UK FY2 applicants were appointable,
but did not receive a training appointment.

The NHS has demonstrably run out of jam for its "jam tomorrow" policy,
resulting in resident doctors being treated as little more than glorified
temps. Deferring fair compensation on the promise of future rewards has
become an unsustainable and indefensible position.

### An Urgent Call for a Coherent Pay Framework

This is not a minor anomaly to be addressed in due course; it is an
active, ongoing devaluation of the medical profession that demands
immediate attention. The solution is not to reduce the pay of other
professionals but to demand a fundamental realignment of the resident
doctor contract with contemporary workforce realities.

An NHS pay system fit for the 21st century must ensure that clinicians
working equivalent hours under equivalent pressures receive equitable
remuneration that transparently accounts for their respective training,
responsibilities, and legal obligations. To do otherwise is to signal
that years of medical training and the ultimate burden of clinical
responsibility are of secondary importance to the schedule one works.

Equal pay for equal work does not necessitate identical salaries, but
it absolutely requires a rational and defensible approach to valuing
contributions. For an NHS facing an existential workforce crisis, and for
a government that relies on these professionals to deliver care, ignoring
this profound disparity is no longer a viable option. It is a choice:
a choice to accept an unfair system that is actively driving doctors away.
