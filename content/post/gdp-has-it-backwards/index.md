summary: "The US economy shrank because it bought more things from abroad? That's not shrinkage, that's success measured incorrectly."

The [latest figures reported by the US Commerce Department][1] have the
commentators furrowing their brows.  The American economy apparently
'shrank' by 0.3% in the first quarter, a sharp reversal from the previous
quarter's 2.4% growth. Hand-wringing about recession risks inevitably
follows. Yet, buried within the same report is a detail that seems
contradictory: imports surged by over 40%.

How can an economy 'shrink' when it's acquiring more stuff from the
rest of the world? The answer lies in Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
mechanics and interpretation.

Firstly, the stock accounting. GDP aims to measure the value of goods and
services produced domestically. When Americans buy imported goods
(Consumption), or companies invest in foreign machinery (Investment), or
the government buys foreign supplies (Government Spending), these values
are initially included in C, I, or G. To avoid counting foreign production
as domestic, imports (M) are subtracted in the formula GDP = C + I + G +
(X - M). This subtraction is an accounting adjustment to isolate domestic
production, not necessarily a judgment that imports are inherently 'bad'.

Secondly, the flow economic impact. Beyond the accounting, there's
the concept of 'leakage'. Money spent on imports flows out of the
domestic economy. Unlike money spent on domestically produced goods
and services, it doesn't directly fund domestic wages or profits in the
next round of the income-expenditure cycle. In this sense, a surge in
import spending can dampen the domestic economic activity rate that
GDP seeks to measure. This is the standard view: imports leak demand
away from domestic producers.

But does this GDP figure, reflecting both the accounting adjustment and
the leakage effect, truly capture the state of national well-being? The
official explanation for the recent US import surge was companies
stockpiling goods ahead of tariffs. Warehouses filled up. This looks
negative from the perspective of GDP calculation and domestic economic
churn. However, for the potential consumer, having access to more
goods – potentially cheaper than they might be later – seems like a
benefit. The availability of physical goods increased, enhancing the
potential standard of living, even if domestic activity measured by
GDP took a hit.

This highlights the limitations of using GDP as the sole barometer
of economic health. It measures the pace of domestic production
and spending, but not necessarily the outcome in terms of material
well-being or access to goods. A country isn't just a production machine;
it's also a place where people live and consume.

From the consumption and living standards perspective, the traditional
GDP view can seem backward. Exports represent real output – goods
and services made with domestic resources – being sent away. Imports
represent real output from elsewhere being brought in for domestic
use. When you buy that German car, the money leaves (the leakage), but
the vehicle arrives (the material gain). The obsession with maximising
(X-M) – the trade surplus – prioritises sending goods away over
bringing them in.

Imagine a hypothetical Martian colony that imports everything it needs
from Earth, paying in digital credits it can issue freely. Its domestic
production (GDP) might be zero. The leakage would be total. Yet its
citizens could enjoy a high standard of living. Would we call this
economy a failure?

The 'export-led growth' narrative often benefits corporations and
financiers accumulating foreign currency, but does it always benefit
the average citizen? They work to produce goods enjoyed elsewhere,
while the potential gain from imports (lower prices, more choice) is
sometimes downplayed or restricted.

The recent US data, viewed critically, shows an economy successfully
acquiring vast amounts of the world's output. Yes, the spending on these
goods represents a leakage from the domestic income cycle, dampening
the US growth cycle. However, the arrival of these goods represents
a potential increase in material well-being. To call this 'shrinkage'
without qualification is to mistake the measure of economic activity
for a measure of national prosperity itself. Perhaps we need better ways
to assess how well an economy is actually serving its people beyond the
simple churn of domestic GDP.
