The [latest figures reported by the US Commerce Department][1] have
the commentators furrowing their brows. The American economy apparently
'shrank' by 0.3% in the first quarter, a sharp reversal from the previous
quarter's 2.4% growth. Hand-wringing about recession risks inevitably
follows. Yet, buried within the same report is a detail that throws the
entire narrative into question: imports surged by over 40%.

Hold on. The US economy 'shrank' because Americans... bought more stuff
from the rest of the world?  According to the official GDP formula,
this is bad news. Imports are subtracted from the total, so more imports
make the economy look smaller. It’s a strange accounting quirk that
leads us to treat acquiring more goods from abroad as if it’s somehow
a loss. But it isn’t.

The logic behind subtracting imports is misunderstood. Imports don't
reduce GDP because they "take away" demand; they are subtracted to
avoid double-counting. When a foreign-made good is consumed or stocked
by a company, it first enters the GDP calculation under consumption or
investment. Subtracting it is a corrective, not a penalty. The result:
imports tend to have no net effect on GDP.

So why the panic?

The official explanation for the import surge is that companies were
frantically stockpiling goods to get ahead of impending tariffs. So,
warehouses across America are now bulging with foreign-made products. For
the bean counters calculating GDP, this is bad news. For the average
American who might eventually buy these products, perhaps at a
lower price than if they'd arrived post-tariff, it's hard to see the
downside. Presently, they have more access to physical goods. Isn't
that, in a tangible sense, an increase in the standard of living, at
least potentially? At least for now.

This highlights the fundamental absurdity at the heart of GDP as the
unquestioned totem of economic health. It treats a national economy
like a business, obsessing over the trade balance sheet. But a country
isn't a company. The goal isn't simply to rack up accounting surpluses
against other nations. Surely, an economy's aim should be its population's
material well-being.

From that perspective, GDP has it precisely backwards. Exports
represent real output – tangible goods and services produced
using domestic resources and labour – being sent away for others
to consume. Imports represent real output produced elsewhere being
brought in for domestic consumption. When you buy a German car or a
Vietnamese t-shirt, you gain that item's utility. The dollars flowing
overseas are mere ledger entries; the physical item arriving on your
shores, ready for use, is the tangible reality.

If the goal is human welfare, then receiving more stuff — regardless
of where it’s made — is beneficial. Imports expand consumer choice,
push down prices, and often improve quality. That’s not an economic
loss; it’s a material gain.

Imagine a hypothetical Martian colony that imports everything it needs
from Earth, paying in digital credits it can issue freely. Its GDP would
be zero, since it produces nothing domestically. Yet its citizens could
enjoy a high standard of living, surrounded by Earth-made comforts. Would
we say this economy has failed?

Yet, we are constantly fed the 'export-led growth' narrative as the holy
grail. Governments crow about rising exports as a sign of virility. But
who truly benefits? When a nation exports more, it depletes its own
potential stock of physical goods and services in exchange for foreign
currency reserves or claims on foreign assets. This undoubtedly benefits
the corporations doing the exporting and the financiers shuffling the
resulting capital flows, padding their foreign currency accounts. But
for the average worker in that nation? They've worked to produce goods or
provide services that someone else, somewhere else, gets to enjoy. Their
reward is often stagnant wages while the imports they might
want (or need) never show up.

The recent US data, interpreted through a lens of common sense rather
than GDP dogma, shows an economy acquiring a vast amount of real physical
goods from the rest of the world. Tariff fears might be driving this,
but the result is the same: more stuff available in America. To call this
'shrinkage' is to mistake the map for the territory, the accounting
abstraction for the material reality. Instead of obsessing over GDP,
we should focus on what actually matters: the quantity and quality of
goods and services available to the people living within a nation's
borders. By that measure, a surge in imports looks less like a problem
and more like a nation successfully acquiring the world's surplus output.
