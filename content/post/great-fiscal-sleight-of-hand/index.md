The first, unavoidable task of any Chancellor is to stand before
the despatch box and lament the state of the books. We will hear all
the familiar notes: the cupboard is bare, the nation’s credit card
is maxed out, and tough choices are the only medicine. Rachel Reeves,
a woman steeped in Treasury orthodoxy, will play this part to perfection.

We are told she must hunt for "unfunded" liabilities and find new taxes
to plug a gaping "black hole." The entire Westminster discourse is
trapped in this narrative, a narrative that frames the state's finances
as identical to that of a prudent household. It is a powerful fiction,
and it is one that Ms Reeves seems perfectly content to leverage.

But we should ask what is really happening here. The ritualistic panic
over gilt yields and the deficit obscures a more fundamental truth of
our monetary system, one that HM Treasury understands operationally
even as it denies it rhetorically.

The United Kingdom government is the issuer of the pound sterling. It
is, as some economists describe it, the "constitutive architect" of
the monetary system, not just another user of it. It cannot run out of
the currency it alone creates. When the government spends, it does so
by crediting bank accounts. This spending is not, and has never been,
operationally dependent on receiving tax revenue first. The state is,
for all intents and purposes, [self-financing][2].

The endless question of "how will you pay for it?" is, therefore,
the wrong one. The government’s ability to "afford" new hospitals,
schools, or green energy infrastructure is not a financial question. It
is a question of real resources.  

This is where the true purpose of taxation reveals itself. Taxes are not
a "funding" mechanism. Their vital economic function is to create demand
for the state's currency and, crucially, to free up real resources from
the private sector so they can be provisioned for public use without
causing inflation.

If the new government wishes to invest heavily in, say, a national
insulation programme, the only real constraint is the availability
of building materials, engineers, and construction workers. If these
resources are already fully employed building luxury flats, the
government’s new spending will simply bid up prices.

This is the clue that may explain the Chancellor’s true strategy. Ms
Reeves does not need to raise general taxes to "find the money" for her
spending plans. She needs to raise those taxes to reduce the private
sector's claim on the very resources the government’s public programmes
will require. She is not balancing a spreadsheet; she is managing a
real economy.

Now, what could have given rise to this idea of an ulterior motive? Well,
while trotting out the well-worn lines, former Labour minister Jonathan
Ashworth, now working for Labour Together, [accidentally let the cat
out of the bag][1]:

> What I would say though is if I was still involved in political

This, then, may be the great sleight of hand. The Chancellor will bow
to the ["tiresome iteration"][4] of the household analogy. She will dutifully
"find" the money by raising taxes, satisfying the media and her political
opponents that her sums add up.

But by playing this game, she achieves her real, unstated objective:
reallocating the nation’s productive capacity (its people, its
factories, its raw materials) from private wants towards public
purpose. The debate over the "black hole" is a shadow play, distracting
from the real and far more significant battle over resources.

Come spring, [the Estimates][3] will lay it bare: will the government
truly redeploy resources for the productive public good, or have they
been fully consumed by the folly of fiscal fiction?
