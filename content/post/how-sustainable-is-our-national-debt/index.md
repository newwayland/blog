The UK House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee is [running an inquiry][6]
entitled "How sustainable is our National Debt?"

The [GIMMS][2] written evidence to the inquiry [has now been published.][1]


I'd like to thank to denizens of the New Wayland Discord Server and
everybody in the GIMMS team for their help and encouragement in producing
this evidence.

Given there are a number of MMT informed, if not entirely on point,
[submissions to the inquiry][3] we may be getting somewhere in the UK.

Let's see where it leads.

Don't forget GIMMS is organising [an MMT conference at the University of Leeds, UK in July][4]. The big names will be there, and [tickets are now on sale.][5]
