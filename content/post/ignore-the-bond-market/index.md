In British politics, the bond market has acquired near-mythic status. As
the implacable judge of fiscal virtue, quick to punish any government
that borrows freely, spends boldly, or cuts taxes deeply, it waves
an invisible hand that leaves fingerprints on every budget. Yet few
politicians question whose fingers actually move the lever.

Andy Burnham, mayor of Greater Manchester, recently captured this
paralysis. Britain, he warned the Institute for Fiscal Studies, remains
"in hock to the bond markets" and caught in a "low growth doom loop." This
fear defines the limits on ambitious policy. Nigel Farage shares the
diagnosis. "Even if Andy Burnham thinks you can ignore the bond markets,"
the Reform UK leader shrugged, "in reality you can’t."

A rare consensus across the political spectrum. There is only one problem:
the spectrum is wrong.

The fear is real enough. When rumours of Burnham returning to Westminster
surfaced, benchmark gilt yields twitched, and UK journalists responded
with ritual panic, preening and parroting the party line. Such events
reinforce the belief that the bond market scrutinises government with
hawkish attention, and that signs of loose fiscal policy bring immediate,
material costs.

The foundation of this modern superstition is, of course, the 2022
"Mini-Budget." In the popular imagination, the bond market acted as a
righteous immune system, ejecting Liz Truss for her fiscal sins. This
narrative has become the "Truss Trauma", a haunting reminder used to
discipline any politician who dares to stray from the prescribed path.

But the panic wasn’t a verdict on borrowing levels; it was a mechanical
collision between a sudden change in inflation expectations and a fragile
pension fund system that was over-leveraged on long-dated gilts. The
"vigilantes" didn't ride into town to save the taxpayer; they scrambled
to sell because the Bank of England’s dual role as rate-setter and
bond-buyer had become momentarily incoherent. By misdiagnosing a plumbing
failure as a moral crusade, the political class has handed “The Market"
a veto it never actually earned.

This misdiagnosis has entrenched a deference that shapes every British
political discussion. Politicians from all parties now prostrate
themselves before "The Market." The result is cautious politics,
constrained by the belief that gilt traders have the final word. To
maintain this liturgy of appeasement, politicians propose increasingly
complex schemes. These schemes rely on two delusions: treating optimistic
growth forecasts as fiscal magic, or outsourcing democracy to unelected
committees that purport to read market tea leaves.

The Office for Budget Responsibility sits at the centre of this
theatre. Its forecasts determine compliance with ever more surreal fiscal
rules, while policymakers hope its pronouncements will sway gilt yields
through perceived credibility. More frequent reviews, added oversight,
and further proposed bodies pile up: all aimed at signalling virtue to
avoid the feared market disapproval.

Yet these mechanisms cannot succeed. The bond market narrative exists
for one purpose: to block political change.

Any material change. From any party. In any way.

This becomes clear once you understand the mechanism behind the
myth. Sterling investors have only one aggregate alternative. They can
hold fixed-rate gilts or keep money in floating-rate settlement balances
at the Bank of England, which pays interest at the Bank Rate. Gilt
prices are set relative to this alternative and to the Bank’s policy
for changing that rate. The "bond market" is not a separate beast;
it is a shadow cast by the Bank's own decisions.

Retaining the illusion requires three framing tricks.

First, the long-bond blindspot. Any proposed government policy raises
uncertainty about the future path of the Bank Rate. Investors respond by
selling longer-dated bonds, which carry greater rate risk, and buying
shorter-dated ones. Media reports focus obsessively on rising yields
for 10- and 30-year gilts while ignoring the corresponding decline in
short-dated yields. The panic is selective.

Second, the maturity assumption. Critics cite "rollover risk": the fear
that short-term debt becomes expensive to refinance. But this treats
a currency issuer like a household. Under a free-floating currency,
the Bank of England, not the bond market, sets the short-term interest
rate. HM Treasury can roll over instruments indefinitely, paying roughly
the Bank Rate. The US Treasury has funded new borrowing since early 2025
by issuing more short-term bills without cost penalties. The long-term
constraint is a choice, not a necessity.

Third, the rate-setting trap. Analysts assume the Bank of England must
retain the power to change rates at will. Eliminate this discretion,
and the Bank Rate’s path becomes certain. Suddenly, there is no rate
risk, no need for fixed-rate instruments, and no "bond market" to placate.

These framing tricks make bond market punishment appear inevitable. In
reality, the government can adjust policy or its debt mix and avert
any cost impact. The bond market is mendicant, not master; it merely
reflects choices within the UK’s monetary framework. Keeping variable
rates, favouring long-term debt, and tolerating selective reporting feed
the myth.

Politicians and commentators invoke the bond market as an outside enforcer
of fiscal virtue. Dispel the framing tricks, adjust the tools, and the
supposed monster loses its power.

The bond market does not rule British politics. British politics chooses
to be ruled by a distorted view. It is time to unchoose it.
