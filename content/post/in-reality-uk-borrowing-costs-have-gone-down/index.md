For the past fortnight, sections of the British press have staged a
familiar drama. The script runs as follows: a government in disarray,
aides departing, leadership under strain, and, inevitably, a verdict
from “The Bond Market”. Gilt yields "surged", readers were told. The
Telegraph suggested Starmer might [sacrifice his Chancellor to avert
a “bond crisis”][3]. CNBC identified a ["'Damocles sword' over Britain's bond market"][4].
[Reuters][8], [The Guardian][6], [Bloomberg][7], [MorningStar][9], and the [Financial Times][5]
traced a direct line from Westminster speculation to national peril,
warning that markets were losing faith in British governance.

This performance is not new. The beneficiaries are well known.

The staging is meticulous. Attention is drawn to the 10-year gilt and the
30-year—the longer maturities where uncertainty weighs heaviest and
duration risk is most pronounced. The upward movement is highlighted,
spikes are pointed out, and alarm invited. This is the "Truss Trauma"
reflex: a conditioned response that seeks to constrain every British
politician. Deviate from fiscal rectitude, suggest any significant change
and the “bond vigilantes” will punish. The narrative is presented as
ironclad. The conclusion is predetermined. But the evidence is selective.

Highlighted evidence is curated evidence. The yield curve is not
merely a point captured during peak anxiety. It is a term structure of
expectations, a full profile that must be viewed in its entirety.

And, presently, it looks like this:

As you can see, the yield on the short end has fallen over the last year,
as we would expect given that the rate is determined relative to the
Bank Rate. For example, this is the progress of the 2-year gilt over
the last year:

{{< figure src="two-year.png" alt="2 year gilt - Feb 2026" >}}

The real constraint lies elsewhere. If market participants want short,
and [we're still going to issue gilts][2], then give them short. [It's not as
though they have any aggregate alternative][1]. The Debt Management Office's
issuance remit remains far too broad, allowing sales across the curve
without regard to relative cost. If the DMO were directed to prioritise
the lowest-yielding gilts each week and to avoid offerings exceeding
Bank Rate where feasible, the scope for perceived "bond crises" would
narrow significantly.
