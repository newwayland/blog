[Neil Wilson][3], Richard Tye and Andrew Berkeley

[In this paper][1] we challenge the widespread public and institutional
misconception that legal tender laws in English law compel creditors to
accept payment in a specific form. We argue that legal tender is a narrow,
procedural artefact with diminishing practical relevance. Through an
analysis of statutory provisions, common law, and the Civil Procedure
Rules, we demonstrate that legal tender serves not as a substantive
right to discharge debts but as a limited procedural defence concerning
liability for costs in litigation. By examining the institutional
mechanisms for settling private contractual debts and public statutory
obligations, such as taxes, we show that settlement occurs almost
exclusively through electronic, bank-mediated systems. The paper concludes
that the operational currency of the modern state is not physical legal
tender but central bank reserves and commercial bank money, rendering
legal tender a concept of largely historical and symbolic significance.
