[The Minimum Wage Jobs (MWJ) Framework][1] is the most operationally efficient
version of a Job Guarantee for the United Kingdom. It achieves the dual
objective of a modern stabilisation system: eliminating involuntary
unemployment while providing a permanent anchor for inflation.

By utilising existing legal and operational infrastructure, MWJ
enables public-purpose employers, such as charities, the NHS, and
local authorities, to scale up their work by drawing on a ready supply
of available workers. The process is integrated into the heart of the
UK’s tax system; employers simply notify the government of a scheme
participant via a new field in their standard PAYE Real Time Information
(RTI) submissions.

This framework removes the financial barriers to expanding public-purpose
services. For each eligible worker, the Department for Work and Pensions
(DWP) pays wages directly and settles all tax and National Insurance
with HMRC. Participating organisations can engage full-time labour at
zero gross payroll cost, enabling social value and community projects
to be delivered without personnel budget constraints.

In addition, MWJ serves as a powerful automatic stabiliser. Participation
scales naturally with the economy, rising during downturns and falling
during booms, and responding immediately to local labour-market
conditions. Unlike interest-rate changes, which suffer from long,
variable lags, MWJ provides a surgical response to economic shifts.

Crucially, by shifting macroeconomic stabilisation from the money market
to the labour market, MWJ ends the practice of using unemployment as an
inflation-control tool and removes the economy’s structural dependence
on interest rate hikes. As a result, interest rates can settle at their
natural, permanently low level, providing immediate and lasting relief
to millions of mortgaged and renting households.

The framework is a fully distributed policy that requires no new
agencies, committees, or open-ended ministerial powers. It functions
as a seamless extension of the existing tax and benefit architecture,
operating automatically across every region and nation of the UK. The
system is designed to be "light-touch," integrating seamlessly with the
distinct tax policies of devolved governments. By processing payments
through the established PAYE and RTI frameworks, the policy scales to
local needs rather than through central command.

Implementation is pragmatic and low-risk. One-off implementation costs
are conservatively estimated at £100 million, with annual running costs
under £50 million: less than the current cost of operating the Monetary
Policy Committee and the Debt Management Office.

The result is a transformational reform that is operationally simple,
fiscally responsible, and deliverable within a single Parliament.
