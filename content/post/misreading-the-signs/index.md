[Matthew Lynn's recent article][1] ("The UK is heading for a full-blown
financial crash, and nothing can stop it now") paints a dramatic picture
of fiscal doom, arguing that rising government borrowing figures
signal an inevitable economic collapse. While the borrowing numbers
themselves are significant, the conclusion that they spell imminent
disaster fundamentally misunderstands how government finance works in a
country like the UK, which issues its own floating-rate currency. Lynn's
analysis, focused solely on the government's deficit, misses the other
side of the equation: the non-government sector's surplus.

### The Accounting Identity: Deficits Equal Surpluses

At the heart of the misunderstanding is a failure to grasp a basic
national accounting identity: **the government's deficit (spending more
than it taxes) is, pound-for-pound, equal to the combined surplus of the
non-government sector (households, businesses, and the foreign sector).**

Think of it this way: when the government spends pounds into the economy
(e.g., on public sector wages, infrastructure, benefits), it credits
bank accounts in the private sector. When it taxes, it debits those
accounts. If the government spends more than it taxes (runs a deficit),
it has credited *more* pounds to the non-government sector than it
debited. This net injection of pounds *is* the non-government sector's
financial surplus – their net savings in pounds sterling.

Therefore, the £151.9 billion the government borrowed over the last year
isn't just disappearing into a void; it represents £151.9 billion that
the non-government sector (UK households, UK firms, and overseas entities
combined) [chose to save][2] in the form of sterling financial assets (like
government bonds or bank deposits) [rather than spend][3]. Saving *requires*
borrowing somewhere else in the system.

### Reframing The Arguments

Seen through this lens, Lynn's points look very different:

1. **"Horrific" Borrowing Figures:** Instead of inherently bad, these
figures indicate a significant desire or need within the non-government
sector to net-save pounds. The government's deficit is *accommodating*
this desire. The critical question isn't "Why is the government borrowing
so much?" but "Why does the non-government sector want to save so
much?" Possible answers include economic uncertainty, deleveraging after
past borrowing, or foreign desire to hold sterling assets.
2. **Causes of Borrowing (Spending/Revenue):** Lynn points to public
sector pay rises and departmental spending driving up the deficit. Yes,
this increases government spending. But this spending becomes income
for the non-government sector. If that income isn't entirely spent
(i.e., some is saved), the government deficit simply reflects that
saving gap. Similarly, disappointing tax revenues (corporation tax,
VAT) reflect lower economic activity and spending *by the non-government
sector*. This lower activity *increases* the private sector's net saving
(or reduces its dissaving). It thus necessitates a larger government
deficit to maintain overall demand.
3. **"Lost Control":** Has the Chancellor "lost control"? Or is the
government responding, perhaps passively, to the macroeconomic reality
that the non-government sector is demanding a large surplus? Attempting
to drastically cut the deficit *against* this desire for saving (through
immediate, harsh austerity) wouldn't magically balance the books; it would
likely shrink the economy, reduce tax revenues further, and potentially
worsen the deficit-to-GDP ratio while causing significant hardship.
4. **Impending "Crash":** The idea of a "crash" based on borrowing
levels misunderstands sovereign currency issuance. Unlike a household
or a country using a foreign currency (like a Eurozone member), the UK
government cannot involuntarily run out of the pounds it creates. It
faces no solvency risk in its own currency. The real constraints are
inflation (if spending outstrips the economy's productive capacity)
and the availability of real resources (labour, materials, energy),
not the nominal borrowing figure itself. Lynn's prediction conflates
the government's finances with those of a household budget.
   
### Focusing on the Real Issues

This doesn't mean government deficits are irrelevant. How the money is
spent matters (is it productive investment or inefficient spending?),
and excessive deficits relative to the economy's capacity *can* cause
inflation. The *composition* of spending and taxation and their impact
on distribution and economic potential are crucial debates.

However, portraying high borrowing figures *in themselves* as proof of an
impending "crash" is misleading and ignores fundamental macroeconomic
relationships. The government's deficit is the mirror image of the
non-government's savings. Before panicking about the former, we need to
understand the latter. Matthew Lynn's analysis fails to do this, leading
to a conclusion rooted more in rhetoric than sound economic reasoning. The
focus should be on managing the real economy – inflation, employment,
productive capacity – not chasing arbitrary deficit targets based on
a flawed understanding of national accounts.
