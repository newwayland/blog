It's always entertaining whenever somebody tries to critique MMT using the
term "money printing".  There is no greater tell that the person hasn't
the first clue what they are talking about, and that they are still in thrall
to the Wizard of Oz illusion rather than understanding what is going on
behind the curtain.

Once you take the time to actually understand MMT and what it is explaining
then you'll know that **money printing is a form of taxation**.

All of which follows, once again, from understanding the institutional
structure of how notes come about and how they affect the balance sheets
of the organisations that use them.

## How Cash Gets in Your Hands

Let's go through the process, so you can see how this apparent paradox
comes about.

In the UK, bank notes are primarily the responsibility of the Bank of
England. Legislation splits the balance sheet of the Bank of England in
two. There is the Banking Department which does the normal central banking
operations and the Issue Department which looks after the creation and
distribution of bank notes. The two are accounted separately in the
[Bank of England Accounts.][1]

Officials in the Issue Department instruct a printer, currently De La
Rue, to create bank notes who are paid for their services by the Bank in
the usual fashion: charging the appropriate HM Treasury account in the
Banking Department, marking up the Banking Department account of De La
Rue's banker and issuing an instruction to that bank to mark up De La
Rue's account.

This is the cost of production of the notes, which last year totalled
some £78 million.

After that, the notes are distributed throughout the banking system,
based upon the demand of the commercial banks for notes to fill their
cash machines and counter tills. This happens via the Note Circulation
Scheme and Wholesale Cash Distribution network. ([Gory details in this
current review][2])

Note distribution costs the Bank of England £31 million, which again
it pays by transfer from the appropriate HM Treasury owned account.

In total £117 million was paid out in FY2019 for to create and distribute
notes.

## Now the Taxing Part

How do the Banks demand the notes in the first place?

By offering assets in exchange. 

Specifically deposits held at the Banking Department of the Bank of
England or Gilts/Treasury Bills issued by HM Treasury.

Which of course they have to have on hand *before* they can order any
notes from the printers.

If the bank tenders a deposit at the Banking department, then the
commercial bank's deposit is reduced (debited) and the Issue Department's
account in the Banking Department increased (credited).

If the bank tenders a Gilt or Treasury Bill, then the Issue Department
enters into a [reverse repo arrangement][3] with the bank, where the
underlying settlement is to return the notes, or a Banking Department
deposit.

Both of these processes mean that the commercial bank hands over interest
bearing assets to the Issue Department in return for non-interest bearing
notes. **The resulting reduction in income of the bank is the tax**.

The notes end up as assets on the bank's balance sheet, where they stay
until you go to a Cashpoint and draw some out, whereupon the liability of
the bank to you is reduced, and so is the bank's stock of notes.

## How Big is the Tax?

The banks have to pay the face value of the notes, not just the production
costs. For FY2019 the banks transferred to the Issue Department £257
million of assets in exchange for additional notes.

That £257 million is added to the asset pile in the Issue Department
which totalled £71.7 billion at FY2019 and which generated £703 million
in income. £555 million of which was transferred back to HM Treasury. 

All of this is income the banks would have earned had they no notes.

## Hold On. Haven't I Seen This Before?

The process is remarkably similar to that used by the [Asset Purchase
Facility][4] (the UK's implementation of QE - Quantitative Easing)
which does essentially the same thing on the Banking Department side.
Income earning assets of the banks and financial companies are removed
and replaced with lower income earning assets, with the difference paid
over to HM Treasury.  It's **just another form of tax** reducing the
income of the non-government sector.

And that's why, despite mountains of QE, not a lot has happened. First
you have to overcome a £14.5 billion drain in income. 

Now when you see somebody talking about "money printing" you can smile
quietly to yourself and think...
