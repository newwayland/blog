[Back in August]({{< relref "onward-to-100-nmol" >}}) I
started an experiment to see what Vitamin D supplements would do
to my serum levels. After [boosting them for 8 weeks]({{< relref
"to-100-nmol-update" >}}) I switched to a maintenance dose over
the winter. 

## Process followed

Using the [same tablets as before][1] I took 2000 IU per day (two tablets)
on a morning with breakfast. Compliance was good over the period I feel.

Activity has been down to 2050 steps on average due to the winter
weather conditions. I've still managed to avoid catching respiratory
illnesses, although of course the conditions this year have been very
unusual due to the continuing Covid lockdowns.

The end of April/beginning of May represents the point at which the sun
gets above 45 degrees at noon at my latitude, which is the point at which
the sun is strong enough to trigger skin synthesis of Vitamin D. That
will last until approximately the end of August.

## Results

The latest results [from the lab](https://www.vitamindtest.org.uk) are:

```
Total Vitamin D : 103.5 nmol/L
Status: ADEQUATE
```

which is an increase of 15.4 nmol/L over the six months since
October. That likely means that 2000 IU was a little too much and I should
have stuck with single tablet 1000 IU supplementation recommended on the
bottle. At this time of year you should be at the lower bound of the
target useful range (allegedly around 75 nmol/L).

## Follow up

I intend to drop supplementation from now on until the end of August and
go back to 1000 IU per day from then. With an adequate diet and adequate
sunlight over the summer that should maintain the levels.

I may test again in a year to test that theory but we'll see. Now we have Covid
vaccination we have a better way to stop the impact of the virus. I've
had mine and it was fine. Make sure you get yours.

I hope you've enjoyed this short series. It's been fun doing a little bit
of actual science in the great tradition of personal experimentation. Feel
free to drop onto the Discord if you have any comments or queries.
