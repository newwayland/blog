One aspect of commercial life that has always annoyed me is the habit
of some project managers to refer to people as “resources”. It’s
a wonderfully dehumanising phrase that lumps human beings, with their
thoughts, feelings and aspirations, into the same category as steel ingots
and rebar, to be shipped around as required by an unfeeling bureaucracy.

That same disconnect is now creeping into opinion pieces as they struggle with the Modern Money reality we live in.
Ross Clark's [article today][1] has the classic attempt at rebuff:

> But while you can print money, you can’t print resources

Then further down the article

> What will we think of lockdowns when we have several million unemployed, and public services are having to be slashed to stave off our creditors?

The usual lines, of course, all without putting two and two together and
realising that the unemployed **are** the resources that back the money that
is created.

If nobody else is using these people, they can be hired for the public
good. Besides, the government is morally obliged to hire them since it
is the policy of the government that has made them unemployed.

In aggregate, the only way the government can get rid of all
these workers is if the private sector hires them. Otherwise we end
up paying public workers to do nothing rather than paying them to
do something. And that makes no sense. 

We have spent the best part of a year paying a good deal of the country
80% of their wages to remain on standby.  The creditors to stave off
are nowhere to be seen. There is no shortage of stuff on the shelf. How
many more billions of Gilts do we have to sell at near-zero redemption
yields? Surely by now, it should be clear that the old mental model is
just a laughable anachronism.

Perhaps the mental blockage is the
horrible realisation that an awful lot of private sector activity adds
about as much real value to the economy as a government furlough payment.

The task of the private sector is to invest capital and replace drudgery
with advanced machinery. As we can see this year, it's well on its
way, which is something that should be celebrated and encouraged.
