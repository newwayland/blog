A recent BBC headline, ["How the West is helping Russia to fund its war
on Ukraine,"][1] published on May 30, 2025, presents a familiar narrative:
Russia, reportedly awash in foreign currency from its fossil fuel sales,
is using these "Western billions" to bankroll its ongoing war. The
article starkly points out that "Ukraine's Western allies have paid
Russia more for its hydrocarbons than they have given Ukraine in aid,"
highlighting a staggering €883bn earned by Russia since February 2022,
despite sanctions.

While the sheer scale of these export revenues is undeniably jarring,
and the moral implications of such purchases are deeply unsettling,
the BBC's analysis of Russia's war funding misses a crucial economic
point. The narrative that Russia needs these euros and dollars to
pay its soldiers, forge tanks, or churn out shells for military use
oversimplifies the fundamental realities of sovereign currency.

## The Rouble Reality: Russia's Domestic Spending Power

A fundamental truth often overlooked in much mainstream analysis,
including this BBC piece, is that Russian oil and gas companies do not
pay their taxes to the Russian government in US dollars or euros. They
pay in Russian roubles.

When these energy giants receive foreign currency (FX) from their exports,
that FX does not directly inflate the Russian government's capacity to
spend within its economy. Instead, these companies typically convert
their FX earnings into roubles – often through the Central Bank of
Russia or the National Wealth Fund. These institutions then absorb the
foreign currency, issuing the necessary roubles back to the companies,
which are then used for domestic obligations, including their tax bills.

Crucially, as the sole issuer of the rouble, the Russian state does not
need to earn foreign currency to spend in its own currency. The
primary constraint on domestic war spending isn't a shortage of FX
reserves; it's the availability of real resources: the labour, the
production capacity, the raw materials, and the technology. If Russia
can produce something domestically, it can, in rouble terms, afford it.

## If Oil Sales Dry Up, Does the War Machine Stop? Not Necessarily.

The BBC article strongly implies that cutting off Western purchases
of Russian oil and gas would significantly hamper Russia's ability to
fund its war. While a loss of FX revenue would certainly impact Russia's
capacity to import from certain nations, it does not inherently shackle
its ability to fund domestic production.

Consider a scenario where no country purchases Russian oil. The Russian
government could still instruct its energy companies to produce oil,
even without external buyers. Instead of earning FX and selling the FX
to the Central Bank in exchange for roubles, the oil firms could sell
the oil directly. The oil might sit unused or even be discarded, but
the capacity to pay domestic arms manufacturers or soldiers in roubles
would remain intact.

What truly matters isn't the export revenue itself but whether Russia
can acquire the necessary imports to fuel its war machine. If it
can substitute foreign components domestically or source them through
alternative channels, then export revenues become a secondary concern.

## Sanctions: The Complex Reality of Restricting Imports

This brings us to the actual strategic aim of sanctions: to limit
Russia's access to vital imported goods and technology. The theory is
sound: without advanced components like microchips or precision tools,
Russia's military-industrial complex could, in time, degrade.

However, this strategy faces significant real-world hurdles. While
FX is undoubtedly useful for imports from the West, its importance
diminishes as Russia's trade with China and other non-Western partners
booms. Much of Russia's external trade now bypasses the dollar or euro,
often conducted in national currencies like the yuan. If China is willing
to supply goods and extend credit in CNY, then a shortage of Western FX
becomes far less of a bottleneck.

Furthermore, a genuinely global embargo is impractical. While over 50
countries have imposed some form of sanctions on Russia, the vast majority
of the world – particularly in the Global South – have not. Major
economic players, such as China and India, continue to trade with Moscow
and, in some cases, have even strengthened these relationships. Given
China's pivotal role in global supply chains, the ability of Western
powers to pressure Beijing into economic disengagement is, at best,
limited.

## The Geopolitical Dimension: A Multipolar World Limits Sanction Efficacy

The BBC article briefly touches on the "refining loophole," but it
largely overlooks the broader geopolitical currents at play. Western
sanctions now operate in a multipolar world. When Western markets close
their doors, Russia pivots to other major economies. As long as nations
like China and India refuse to join the sanctions regime, Russia will
maintain access to both markets for its exports and crucial sources
for its imports. Sanctions undoubtedly increase friction and costs,
and they do restrict access to specific high-tech items, but they are
highly unlikely to deliver a knockout economic blow.

## Repeating Flawed Narratives Doesn't Help

For the Western public, a clear and unvarnished understanding of these
economic and geopolitical forces is essential. While the moral objection
to financing an aggressor through energy purchases is valid and deeply
felt, the actual mechanisms of that financing and the true effects of
sanctions demand far greater rigour. Framing Russia's FX income as
the sole or primary enabler of its war effort fundamentally distorts
the reality.

Similarly, overestimating Western leverage over global trade networks
and underestimating Russia's economic adaptability leads directly to
misguided expectations and ineffective policy. The real challenge is
to comprehend and engage with a multipolar world where economic power
is diffuse, alliances are fluid, and Western dominance is no longer
assured. Crafting genuinely effective long-term strategies requires not
just moral clarity but profound economic literacy.
