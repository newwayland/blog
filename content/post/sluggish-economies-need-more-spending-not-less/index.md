Journalist Jeremy Warner [recently argued][1] that further tax rises
under the current Labour government would exacerbate the UK’s economic
woes. While his critique captures the frustration of many, it is rooted
in faulty economic beliefs—particularly those that treat taxation and
spending as intimately linked within a fixed budgetary framework. Such
ideas might hold sway in a fixed exchange rate system, but they fail to
account for the monetary realities of a floating currency like Sterling.

Here’s the article he should have written: 

## Sluggish Economies Need More Spending, Not Less

When in a hole, stop digging. Unfortunately, the government seems
determined to reach for the shovel, doubling down on economic missteps
instead of addressing the underlying issues.

Economics isn’t complex: if an economy is stalling, the last thing
it needs is dampening demand through austerity or ill-conceived tax
hikes. Yet we’re witnessing just that—a perpetuation of flawed
fiscal rules and a failure to understand monetary dynamics. It’s not
just misguided; it’s counterproductive.

The government’s fiscal rules stipulate that revenues must balance
day-to-day expenses and that debt, measured as [public sector net
financial liabilities (PSNFL)][3], must fall as a percentage of GDP within
five years. While these rules might seem sensible, they’re based on
misunderstandings of how money and taxation work in a modern floating
exchange rate economy.

### Capital Spending: The Key to Balancing the Budget

Here’s the reality: government spending drives taxation, not vice
versa. Every pound the government spends circulates through the economy,
generating taxation along the way. Roughly 85% of expenditure returns
as tax revenue, while the remaining 15% is saved by individuals or
businesses, showing up as the government’s so-called “deficit.”

Given this, balancing the current budget—day-to-day spending versus
revenue—is not a challenge if the government shifts its focus to
capital expenditures. Investments in infrastructure, housing, and public
services not only avoid the current budget calculation but also stimulate
economic activity, creating jobs and driving the very tax revenues needed
to satisfy fiscal rules.

### Reassessing the Role of the Private Sector

Concerns about the flight of capital—wealthy individuals moving
abroad—are overstated. Sterling-denominated assets cannot leave the
economy; they merely change hands. And considering the lack of substantial
investment from the ultra-wealthy over the past decades, transferring
ownership to those more likely to spend or invest productively could
actually revitalise economic activity.

The same logic applies to businesses. The government’s decision
to increase National Insurance may lead some firms to release staff,
but this isn’t a crisis—it’s a reallocation of resources. Public
sector spending, which has increased by 4.8%, will absorb many of these
workers, either directly or in firms servicing the public sector. This
deliberate shift reflects voters’ priorities: stronger public services
and investment over business tax cuts.

### The Myth of Fiscal Headroom

The idea of “fiscal headroom”—the gap between revenues and spending
as a measure of affordability—is an illusion. Governments with monetary
sovereignty, like the UK, are not constrained by revenue when it comes
to spending. The true constraints are physical: Do we have the workers,
materials, and infrastructure to deliver the desired projects?

For example, increasing capital expenditure to build housing or upgrade
transport networks doesn’t just create jobs; it enhances the economy’s
capacity, generating long-term growth. This is where the focus should
lie—not on arbitrary fiscal targets but tangible improvements in the
country’s productive capabilities.

### Why Fiscal Rules Are Performative

[The fiscal rules][2] are little more than political theatre. History shows
they are revised or abandoned whenever they threaten to constrain
necessary action. They exist to appease markets and critics, but
they’re not binding in any meaningful sense. Instead of adhering
to these artificial constraints, the government should prioritise
reality-based decision-making.

A sound economic policy would abandon these rules entirely and focus
on the fundamentals: do we have the people, resources, and processes to
implement the projects that will improve lives and drive growth? If so,
spend. If not, invest in building those capacities. Anything else is
a distraction.

### A New Path Forward

To escape the current malaise, the government must embrace an
investment-led recovery. Public spending on infrastructure, healthcare,
and education isn’t just a moral imperative; it’s an economic
one. These investments create jobs, stimulate demand, and lay the
groundwork for sustained prosperity.

Correctly targeted, such investments will  “crowd in” private
sector investment. By increasing overall demand and reducing economic
uncertainty, the government can create an environment where businesses
feel confident to invest. Reduced risk and higher potential returns
incentivise private enterprises to participate in the economic recovery,
further amplifying growth.

The UK’s fiscal framework should reflect this reality. By recognising
the dynamic relationship between spending and taxation and leveraging
the flexibility of a floating exchange rate system, the government can
meet its fiscal goals without undermining the economy.

In times of economic stagnation, the solution isn’t to tighten belts but
to invest boldly. The question isn’t whether we can afford it—it’s
whether we can afford not to.
