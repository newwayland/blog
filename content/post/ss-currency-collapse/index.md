A core myth promoted by "sound money" advocates is that the value of
Sterling is a fragile flower, held together by nothing more than "faith"
and the government's willingness to bribe savers with interest.

The argument typically runs like this: *“If the government stops
paying interest on its debt, or stops issuing gilts, nobody will want
Sterling. There will be a collapse in the value of the currency as
everyone rushes for the exits.”*

This view is rooted firmly in the past. It is a hangover from a fixed
exchange rate world that died in the 1970s, yet it continues to haunt
the nightmares of commentators who [haven't quite grasped how a modern
floating currency actually works][1].

Unsurprisingly, it also serves those who profit from the current
arrangement. The "sound money" crowd isn't just wrong: it's entrenched
and enriched.

### **Who is Faith? HM Inspector of Taxes, That’s Who**

First, let’s deal with the "faith" argument. You often hear that we
must maintain "faith" in the currency. But currency is not a religion;
it is a legal and accounting construct.

You don’t need "faith" to require Sterling. You need Sterling because
the British state has the power to levy taxes and the courts have the
power to enforce contracts denominated in Sterling. If you owe HMRC,
or have a mortgage or business contract in the UK, you need the tokens
the government supplies. If you don’t get them, you end up bankrupt
or in jail.

That creates a permanent, structural demand for the currency that has
nothing to do with "belief" and everything to do with the practical
reality of avoiding the heavy hand of the law.

### **The Missing Buyer**

The "currency collapse" crowd always focuses on the seller. They imagine
a stampede of people "getting out" of Sterling. But they never seem to
ask the most basic question when selling anything: **To whom?**

In a floating exchange rate regime, [Sterling doesn't just disappear into
a black hole][2]. It isn't like the Gold Standard, where you could "cash in"
your notes for a physical commodity and take it somewhere else. Every
time someone sells Sterling, someone else is, by definition, *buying* it.

When the "currency collapse" theorists imagine a mass exit, they are
thinking in terms of the old fixed-rate logic—where you swapped your
Sterling for Dollars or Gold held centrally. But in a modern open market,
the person buying that Sterling isn't doing it as a favour. They are
buying because they intend to do something with it within the Sterling
currency zone.

They are buying to:

1. **Spend it:** Purchase British goods and services.  
2. **Invest it:** Buy British assets, businesses, or infrastructure.

When people "hoarding" Sterling (by sitting on interest-bearing government
debt) decide to sell, they are replaced by people who want to put that
currency to work in the real economy. They buy because a growing economy
offers returns that dwarf the old gilt bribes.

### **From Rent-Seekers to Investors**

What the "collapse" narrative describes as a catastrophe is actually
a rebalancing.

If we stop paying people the "free money" of government interest, the
"hot money", and the rent-seekers might indeed leave. They will sell
their Sterling.

Yet the new buyers of that same amount of Sterling are intent on spending
and investing it in the UK.

Spending and investing increase GDP. It boosts productive capacity. It
makes the "Sterling zone" more valuable.

How can the price of something go down if it is becoming more valuable? It
can’t – unless we’ve been propping it up wrong all along.

### **The Dip is Real. The Bounce is Too.**

Will there be a dip? Initially, yes. And we should be honest about why:
paying interest on gilts is a hidden import subsidy.

Gilt interest means importers have been paying £50 for what should cost
£60. The rest of us pick up the tab in higher taxes. [Remove the bribe][3],
and Sterling finds its honest level.

This is why those interest savings must flow directly back to the
British people. Using that fiscal headroom to hike the Personal Allowance
changes a subsidy for "hoarders" into a pay rise for workers. You offset
the import adjustment by putting money into the pockets of people who
actually live and spend here.

Sceptics are not wrong about the dip. They're wrong about the depth and
duration. In a world of sophisticated futures contracts, the "pain" of a
shifting exchange rate is largely a private matter for a few slow-moving
hedgers. For the rest of the economy, the J-curve resolves on paper
before it hits the high street.

A growing economy cannot stay cheap for long. Capital chases
returns. Returns follow productivity. Once Britain shifts from
rent-seeking to real investment, the currency will inevitably track any
improvements in the real terms of trade. The dip isn't a warning. It's
a brief adjustment while the builders move in.

### **The Only Shift That Matters**

We shouldn’t fret about those who grumble as the government stops
handing out free pints. The buyers picking up tickets from the quitters
aren’t here for a bung; they’re here to get involved and build.

And that’s the only shift that matters.
