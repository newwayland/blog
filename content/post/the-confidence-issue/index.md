The weekend happened. Many column inches were burned. “Benchmark” gilt
yields rose and fell. Yet, when the dust settled, nothing material had
changed: Keir Starmer remains the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.

In this post, I want to explore why I believe he will stay exactly where
he is. To understand why, we have to wander into the uncharted territory
of the UK constitution. So, strap in.

Whatever your opinion of Starmer, he is a known stickler
for rules—often following them regardless of optics or common
sense. One only has to look at the Chagos Islands deal to see that trait
in action. Crucially, the "rules" for being Prime Minister were explicitly
[enumerated](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5fc60e768fa8f54756cd9215/Dissolution-Principles.pdf)
when the [*Dissolution and Calling of Parliament Act
2022*](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2022/11/introduction)
was passed.

Under these principles, the Prime Minister holds office by virtue of
their ability to command the confidence of the House of Commons. Whether
a government retains that confidence is typically tested by a "Vote of
Confidence" (raised by the PM) or a "Vote of No Confidence" (raised by
the Leader of the Opposition).

Currently, we are in a constitutional stalemate: neither incumbent
believes they could win a snap election. This creates a strange vacuum
where confidence is assumed simply because neither of the two people
empowered to test it wishes to do so.

It is here that I part ways with the [constitutional
interpretation](https://youtu.be/40N-TEbevXs?si=GQdE3yCIw7tCOdoT) put
forward by barrister Steven Barrett. While Barrett is normally an astute
observer, I believe he has let his personal distaste for Starmer cloud
his analysis of the mechanism at play.

Barrett argues that the King could—and should—refuse a request
for dissolution if a successor could be found within the governing
party. However, if threatened by his own party, I expect Starmer would
trigger a formal vote of confidence in his government. If that failed,
he would immediately request a dissolution from the King, invoking the
status quo restored by the 2022 Act:

> A return to the pre-2011 status quo ante will also restore the
> position whereby the Prime Minister, having lost a designated or explicit
> vote of confidence, can either resign or seek a dissolution, which would
> usually be granted and lead to an election.

Starmer’s argument for such a dissolution would be fourfold:

1. At the moment of the challenge, there is no single alternative candidate who can demonstrably command the House.  
2. The Labour Party previously argued that changing leaders *should* trigger an election.  
3. Any alternative leader would likely deviate from the manifesto upon which the party was elected.  
4. Current polling suggests the makeup of the current Parliament no longer reflects the will of the country.

In this situation, the King faces a profound dilemma. For
the Monarch to refuse a dissolution request under the [Lascelles
Principles](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld5802/ldselect/ldconst/100/10005.htm),
he must be "satisfied" that he can rely on finding another Prime Minister
who can govern with a working majority. But could the Labour Party
actually coalesce around a caretaker? While Labour rules state that
the Cabinet and NEC would appoint an interim leader, the reality is a
factional minefield. With major figures already viewed as prospective
successors and Angela Rayner’s position as a potential "kingmaker" or
candidate herself, any "caretaker" would immediately be seen as either a
"stalking horse" or a partisan player in the coming civil war.

If Starmer "flounces off" and refuses to serve as a caretaker himself,
effectively daring the party to govern without a head, the King risks
leaving the country with no government at all while the Labour Party
descends into weeks of internal balloting. Given the risk of such a
vacuum, it would be constitutionally reckless for the King to defer the
dissolution request in the vague hope that a fractured Parliamentary
Labour Party could suddenly find a "unity candidate" they haven't managed
to find in years. Starmer has mastered the ultimate irony: using the very
protocols designed to ensure stability as a "scorched earth" policy to
ensure his own survival.

Starmer [knows the
rules](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt5801/jtselect/jtftpa/1046/104606.htm#_idTextAnchor050),
and he’s going to stick to them no matter what. Invulnerable to anything
resembling reason, he will quite happily throw the Labour Party under
a bus rather than violate anything he considers to be sacrosanct.

In his view, it’s his mandate and nobody else’s. He’s going to
run with it, and woe betide anybody who tries to stop him.
