summary: "We abandoned the gold standard. So why do we still treate trade as though we haven't?"

A "trade deficit" sounds like a national failure, a worrying shortfall
in our country's accounts. Yet imagine for a moment that, instead of a
mysterious missing sum of dollars or pounds, what flew out of our borders
were actual bars of gold. No one would bat an eye at gold exports even if
they exceeded gold imports because we would see them for what they are:
a standard and uncontroversial flow of a traded commodity across borders.

In days of yore, this is precisely what happened. When Britain imported
more than it exported, it shipped gold abroad; when it exported more,
it accumulated gold reserves. [Statisticians invented an artificial
distinction][2] between monetary gold (the portion held by central banks
as official reserves) and non-monetary gold (jewellery, industry,
collectables) to create the impression of a 'balance of payments'
gap. This artificial split allowed statisticians to show "trade in goods"
on one side and "reserve movements" on the other.

That split made sense only as long as every ounce of gold exported had
to be met by an ounce of gold imported or else the central bank would be
forced to defend the conversion peg by buying or selling bullion. In that
world, an actual "deficit" in gold meant the vault was running empty,
and the country might default on their fixed rate promise.

But we abandoned that system decades ago. Once we moved to floating
exchange rates, currencies stopped being promises to deliver gold. They
became valuable products in their own right. The pound isn't a claim
on anything else; it's simply what we agree to use to pay taxes, wages,
and invoices. And like gold, it is freely bought, sold, and held purely
for its own sake.

Yet our accounting conventions haven't fully caught up. We still treat
foreign holdings of sterling reserves and bank deposits as a "financial
account" balancing item, separate from "trade" in goods and services,
even though, in substance, they are traded goods. If a wine merchant
in London wants Chilean wine and pays the Chilean producer in sterling
bank deposits, those deposits aren't mysterious IOUs; they're the export
itself. They settle the wine invoice with the same finality and with
the same future liability as gold sovereigns.

Seen this way, "sterling exports" are no more worrying than "gold
exports." They show that people abroad are choosing to hold pounds,
just as they might choose to hold gold. They might want to save pounds,
invest them, or use them to buy things in the future. When they no longer
want them, they spend or exchange them. These flows rise and fall over
time, but they reflect ongoing, voluntary transactions, not a problem
or a shortfall.

If we exorcise the ghost of gold convertibility from our language and
call currencies what they truly are—"financial goods"—the stigma of
the trade deficit vanishes. Every pound held by a non-resident is not a
liability to be redeemed but an export delivering real value today and
tomorrow. In this light, concerns about "trade gaps" melt away. There
never was a gap, only a continuous, global marketplace in modern
money. Expecting floating exchange rates or protectionist policies to
"close" this non-existent gap is as futile as expecting the mouth of
the River Thames to seal itself shut.

Nobody, [other than the statisticians,][1] raises an alarm when London exports
vast quantities of non-monetary gold; it is rightly seen as a thriving
global marketplace. For precisely the same reason, we should celebrate
when the world chooses to hold pounds. We should treat our currency as
the successful export it has become. The phantom trade deficit is an idea
whose time has passed; it deserves to be laid to rest once and for all.
