summary: "Uncover the myths holding back our economy and explore a bold vision: jobs for all, zero interest rates, and a system designed to serve the many—not the few"

Economics is often described as the dismal science, but it's more apt to
call it the mystical science. For generations, the field has been ruled by
aphorisms that sound profound but crumble under scrutiny. These sayings,
like "tighten your belt in tough times" or "the market knows best," are
not neutral observations. They are myths crafted to justify particular
views of how society should be run—views that often prioritise the
interests of the few over the many.

Take monetarists, for example, with their obsession with controlling
inflation through tight monetary policies. Their aphorisms reinforce the
"sound money" myth, which ultimately serves financiers by ensuring that
debt repayments hold more value than wages. Similarly, New Keynesians push
the myth of the impartial, unelected central bank—a supposedly noble
institution that must remain insulated from democratic accountability
to protect us from our worst instincts. But making "correct decisions" for
whom? These systems, by design, elevate the interests of those who
already hold power and wealth.

### A New Compass for a Modern Economy

In contrast, a more honest approach to economics would start from the
premise that democracy can be trusted—that the people of a nation have
the agency to shape its future via the ballot box. This is the bedrock of
what I see as modern economic thought, encapsulated by a simple aphorism:

**It is better to give poor people a job than rich people a bung**

This phrase cuts through decades of economic dogma to reveal a fundamental
truth: prosperity grows from the ground up. By ensuring everyone who
wants a job has one, we can stop funnelling unearned income to the
wealthy and instead build a society where the labour market—not
financial markets—stabilises the economy.

### Three Pillars of Reform: Interest Rates, Bonds, and Bank Deposits

How does this work in practice? It starts by addressing three
entrenched pillars of the status quo: interest rates, bond markets,
and bank deposits. These are often seen as immutable forces of nature,
but they're merely policy choices—choices we can change.

First, eliminate the Bank Rate and drop interest rates to zero permanently. This
would end the cycle of "bungs" to the wealthy through interest payments
on government debt. Central banks would stop tinkering with rates and
return to their proper role, ensuring the payment system runs smoothly and
affordably while keeping the banks on a short leash via the judicious
raising of the Governor's eyebrow. With interest rates at zero forever, the
cost of borrowing would fall for everyone, reducing mortgage and rent
burdens—a tangible benefit for millions of households.

Second, [dismantle the bond market][1]. Without government bonds, the
so-called "bond vigilantes" lose their leverage. They cannot hold
governments hostage over fiscal policy if there are no bonds to speculate
on. Instead, savings can be safely stored as real money, backed by the
state, without the destabilising effects of financial engineering and
rehypothecation. Removing this layer of complexity simplifies the economy
and shifts power away from financial elites.

Third, ensure that all bank deposits are money. There should be no more
insured limits; instead, they should have the same guarantee as a £20
note. This would make the financial system safer and eliminate the need
for elaborate safety nets to prop up fragile banking practices. By cutting
out the middlemen and the money changers, we would create a system where
savings and payments are secure, simple, and accessible to all.

### Stabilising the Labour Market

Together, these reforms shift economic stabilisation from the market for
money to the market for labour. Instead of relying on unemployment to
control inflation, we offer a straightforward, standard hours job to anyone
who wants one—a genuine opportunity to contribute to society while
ensuring a baseline level of income and dignity. Businesses concerned
about this government expenditure can always hire people away—a clear
indicator that the system is functioning as intended. For those who claim
the standard job pays too much or is "too easy," the solution is simple:
take the job. It's open to everyone.

### The Economic and Political Payoff

The economic benefits are clear. Unemployment disappears, boosting GDP and
eliminating the social costs of joblessness. But the political benefits
are just as significant. The standard job is the lynchpin of this
transformation, providing the stability that allows for a zero Bank Rate
policy. By guaranteeing a job to anyone who wants one, the government can
confidently eliminate interest rates, directly leading to a reduction
in mortgage and rent costs for everyone—including those earning above the
minimum wage. Knowing that a job is always available in the local area
provides not just a safety net but also the conditions for a fairer,
more accessible housing market.

### Anticipating the Criticisms

Of course, these changes would provoke resistance. The battleground
would inevitably shift to the currency exchange rate, as critics claim
these policies would weaken the pound. But that's a debate for another
day. What matters now is recognising that the myths of sound money and
independent central banks have failed to deliver prosperity for the
majority. It's time to chart a new course, one rooted in the simple yet
transformative idea that national economic policy should serve the people
of that nation, not the jet-set globe-trotting elite.
