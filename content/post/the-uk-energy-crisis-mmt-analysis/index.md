summary: "Listening to politicians talk about the UK energy crisis is like watching bald men fighting over a comb. None of them get to the root cause - a shortage of natural gas. When you take an MMT view, that's where you start."

MMT founder, Warren Mosler, summarises the current predicament in his usual pithy and
succinct style in one of my favourite MMT quotes[^1]:

> Little or no consideration has been given to the possibility that higher
prices may simply be the market allocating resources and not inflation.

MMT teaches us that we need to think in real terms, not monetary
terms. Fundamentally, there isn't a one-to-one relationship between
money and stuff. The 'veil over barter' view of money [is just wrong]({{< relref "how-the-governments-super-platinum-credit-card-works">}}) -
plain and simple.

The problem the UK is suffering from at the moment is that there isn't
enough gas and there isn't any available UK export capacity to exchange
for more gas to meet the anticipated winter demand. Even if there were,
there's no guarantee that there would be any gas available to buy or
that winter shipments wouldn't simply be halted by gas export nations to
protect their local populations.

Therefore if we don't suppress demand, there's a very good
chance there simply won't be the gas to supply into the UK market at
any price. At which point we will be rationing by quantity whether we
like it or not.

As MMT explains, it is never a matter of money. There is always the
money because Parliament [can just authorise the expenditure]({{< relref "how-uk-government-payments-are-made" >}}) and it happens. The vital
question is whether there is anything available for sale in exchange
for the denomination. That's where the proposals made so far, by both
politicians and private entities, fall down.

None of the 'funding' mechanisms proposed thus far suppresses gas usage
anywhere else in the economy so it can be transferred to the poor. Nor
do they free up export exchange capacity so we can swap it for more gas. Instead,
they pretend that money is scarce and that if we suppress supposedly
scarce money somewhere that will 'pay for it'.

**It won't.**

1. Taxing rich people won't work because money isn't scarce, gas is. Rich
people don't have a secret supply of gas they are hoarding for winter.

2. Borrowing from banks via a 'tariff deficit fund' won't work because
money isn't scarce, gas is. Banks don't have a secret supply of gas in
their vaults. There is no difference between a 'tariff deficit fund'
and the government just subsidising the retailers directly - other than the banks
earning a cut for creating the money.

3. Confiscating profits from gas production firms[^2] won't work
because money isn't scarce, gas is. Gas production firms don't have a
secret supply of gas either. If they did they'd be selling it at these
sky-high prices.

4. Government buying gas at Spot and selling at a lower fixed price won't
work because it will very likely cause the value of Sterling to collapse.
Unless they also try to strengthen Sterling at the same time by tariffing
or banning other imports to create export exchange space.

5. Putting up interest rates to try and export more Sterling savings
would fast-track the UK to Turkey or Zimbabwe status.  In an economy
suffering from a supply shortage putting up the price of investment is
frankly insane.  There's no more stupid policy than a Faustian pact with
the carry trade.

An MMT analysis shows that we need gas demand suppression, or we need to
transfer that gas demand suppression overseas by strengthening Sterling
and pray markets continue to sell and supply to the highest bidder when
the crunch comes.

But most of all we need to get new energy supplies online ASAP. Increasing the cost of investment funding by
increasing interest rates won't work. In fact it may cause [an interest/price spiral]({{< relref "interest-price-spiral" >}}). 

"But what if we could transfer money around and the gas wouldnâ€™t run out?" I hear you cry.

If we could do the money transfers without affecting anything, then there wouldn't be a crisis
requiring money transfers in the first place.

Gas prices have gone up *because* there is a shortage and the
market is trying to suppress demand to rebalance it with supply. (It
encourages additional supply as well, but that's down the line).

The only direct temporary measure that will work is to stop one person
in the economy from using as much gas so that somebody else in the economy
can use more.

That's what price does by default. The vast swathes of poor who can't
afford to pay high prices would end up using less power. When we initiate
a transfer payment we are really trying to transfer the 'using less power'
bit, not money.

If we transfer that to the rich, what will they stop buying that causes
the same amount of power reduction, or sufficient strengthening of
Sterling to allow us to increase supply?

If we transfer that to the middle class what will they stop buying that
causes the same amount of power reduction, or sufficient strengthening
of Sterling to allow us to increase supply?

Anything else will keep supply and demand out of balance - and will
either force up prices or cause the supply quantity to fail to meet
demand, probably via a collapse in the exchange rate of Sterling.

It's a real Gordian Knot.

What options are there? Not many, frankly, but in order of preference we could:

1. Increase the cost of 'luxury' foreign imports to suppress UK demand for
them or [ban/delay their import]({{< relref "its-the-exporters-stupid" >}}) for the time being. Aiming at Chinese imports is probably best
since that should have less blowback on UK exports, and we can leverage
the Chinese peg to the US dollar. The result should be a strengthening
of the pound which reduces wholesale gas costs in Sterling terms.

2. Limit the domestic price cap to a quantity of kWh per meter per
billing period. If Rishi wants to keep his new swimming pool warm he
needs to be doing it at commercial rates, not domestic ones. There is
every chance here that richer people will just pay the price, which may
impact the Sterling exchange rate unless it also reduces demands for
other imports at the same time. That Labour hasn't proposed a progressive price cap is just
further evidence that it has been captured by metropolitan middle-class
types with a [Robin Hood]({{< relref "robin-hood-mmt-edition">}}) LARP fetish.

3. Quantity rationing. If we stop price allocating the limited quantity of
gas, then we need to replace that with another way of allocating the
limited quantity of gas. Given that electricity is generated
with gas at the margins, then rolling blackouts are the likely result,
particularly if we have a cold winter. Of course the last Three Day
week in 1974 resulted in the fall of the Conservatives
and the rise of a lame duck Labour administration that ended up [calling
in the IMF]({{< relref "uk-borrowed-foreign-currency-from-imf-in-1976">}}), ruling over a Winter of Discontent and ultimately allowing
the rise to power of a certain Margaret Hilda Thatcher...

Strap in. It's going to be a wild ride.

the confiscation is from the pension funds of people currently in work
who will then end up with smaller private pensions in the future. A
favourite trick of Gordon Brown acolytes.
