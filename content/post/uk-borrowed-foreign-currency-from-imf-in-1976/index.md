The 1976 IMF debacle in the UK was a defining moment when the promotion
of full employment ended. Fundamentally though it was a political mistake
by people who didn't understand that floating the UK pound fundamentally
changed how it behaved.

The government was terrified about
a 'run on the pound' and wanted to keep an exchange rate of $2 to the
£. The panic set in with it got to $1.80. Of course since then the £
has been down to near parity with the dollar at one point and the world
didn't end.

It's important to remember that throughout the
Bretton Woods era the UK had made frequent use of the IMF facilities to
keep the pound in it range. And that is what the UK government wanted to
do in 1975 and 1976 using the same old fashioned techniques. But to do
that you have to have sufficient foreign exchange reserves. Providing
those is what the IMF did throughout Bretton Woods, and did again in
1976.

The difference was the size of the loan - the biggest
ever at that point - and the fact that previous drawings had been cleared
by that time. Politically it was a huge win for the opponents of the
Labour approach to government.

What is amusing is that using
fixed exchange rate thinking with floating rate currency areas is still
the problem today.

The nature of the loan is described in [this document](https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/Report_on_a_Study_Mission_to_Greece_Cypr/d27-xI9_UBYC?hl=en&gbpv=1&pg=PA107&printsec=frontcover)
dated 15th December 1976 and the
appropriate section is reproduced below.
