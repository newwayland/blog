Despite the Bank of England [explaining how banking works][1], myths still
circulate—correctly understanding bank deposits and capital leads to
some surprising and perhaps uncomfortable conclusions. Let's explore
a few.

**Deposits Are Loans**

Deposits held at a bank are loans to that bank by the deposit
holder. That's why banks usually pay interest on those deposits—they
compensate you for the loan you have extended to them. Your deposit is
a credit on the bank's balance sheet, so you end up 'in credit' at the
bank. They owe you.

**Reserves Are Also Loans**

Banks hold deposits elsewhere, too—the primary one being at the central
bank in their 'reserve account'. It follows that reserves are loans; only
the borrower, in this case, is the central bank. As you earn interest
on your deposits (typically), banks earn interest on their reserves.

**The Key Difference**

However, there is a key difference between deposits and loans, which is
why we have two words for essentially the same thing. With a deposit,
the borrower sets the interest rate, and the lender can choose to accept
it. In contrast, with a loan, the lender sets the interest rate, and
the borrower decides whether to take it.

**Deposits Are Capital**

Every bank needs a mechanism to absorb losses on its assets. If nothing
else is in place, deposits fill that role. When a bank incurs a loss
on its assets, the deposits in its credit accounts shrink by the same
amount. Spreading losses equally over credit accounts is but one approach;
others exist. Banks create capital schemes to determine whose credit
account takes the hit first.

Bank capital is, in effect, a deposit with additional conditions—greater
restrictions and less access—while typically offering a higher return
for being at the front of the queue when a loss occurs.

In short, every pound in a bank is part of a lending arrangement. The
differences are where you sit in the hierarchy when things go wrong and
who sets the interest rate.
