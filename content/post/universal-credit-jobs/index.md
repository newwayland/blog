[Universal Credit Jobs (UCJ)][1] is the simplest credible version of a
Job Guarantee that can be delivered in the United Kingdom.

It achieves the core macroeconomic objectives of a stabilisation
system: eliminating involuntary unemployment while anchoring inflation,
by transforming the existing Universal Credit system into offers of
employment at the minimum wage for any claimant willing and able to work.

The scheme exploits the existing legal and operational infrastructure. It
allows designated public-purpose employers (charities, the NHS, local
authorities, and similar bodies) to offer full-time roles with a zero
gross wage cost to the employer. The Department for Work and Pensions
(DWP) automatically tops up the worker’s Universal Credit with a new
non-tapered “Minimum Wage Guarantee” element, delivering the full
net minimum wage directly to the claimant.

UCJ is a powerful automatic stabiliser: it expands in downturns, contracts
in booms, and varies regionally with local labour-market conditions. By
shifting macroeconomic stabilisation from the money market to the labour
market, it frees the Bank of England from having to use interest-rate
hikes to create unemployment. Interest rates can be left to settle at
their natural low level, cutting mortgage and rental costs for millions
of households.

The policy is exceptionally light-touch: it requires only two Statutory
Instruments, no primary legislation, no new agencies, and no open-ended
powers. Implementation costs are modest, conservatively £100 million
one-off and under £50 million annually, which is less than the current
cost of running the Monetary Policy Committee and the Debt Management
Office.

The entire package remains one of the least legislatively demanding
transformational reforms in recent decades and can be delivered easily
within a single Parliament.
