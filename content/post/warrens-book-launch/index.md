Yesterday I had the pleasure of speaking at *Under the Bonnet with Warren
Mosler*, the [GIMMS][2] event at the University of Westminster marking the
publication of Warrenâ€™s biography.

Alongside Warren and Phil Armstrong,
I gave a talk titled "Thinking like an MMTer" - a short exploration
of how the MMT perspective helps us see through the myths that
still dominate economic debate.

For the benefit of those in the room, and those who couldn't make it,
[the slides from my presentation are now available][1] along with the presentation script.
