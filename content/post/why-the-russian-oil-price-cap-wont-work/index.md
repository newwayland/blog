The 2020s appear to be a never-ending parade of global groupthink. The
Russian Oil Price Cap is yet another stupid and self-destructive idea
that should have been suffocated at birth. It cannot possibly achieve
what its supporters claim, and it represents emotional value signalling
from the Big Hug Club rather than any semblance of rational thought.

The belief is pure neoliberal hubris, based upon a category mistake
and a complete misunderstanding of how national economies and their
currencies work.

## The Belief

The plan is to impose a price cap of $60 on Russian Federation oil and
refuse insurance to any ship carrying Russian oil above that price
cap, denying Russia the revenue it needs to prosecute its action in
Ukraine. [The US Treasury Secretary, Janet Yellen, said][1] the oil
price cap “will help us achieve our goal of restricting Putin’s
primary source of revenue for his illegal war in Ukraine”.

She continued: “Today’s action will also help further constrain
Putin’s finances and limit the revenues he’s using to fund his
brutal invasion. With Russia’s economy already contracting and its
budget increasingly stretched thin, the price cap will immediately cut
into Putin’s most important source of revenue.”

This rhetoric is [repeated across the West][2]. However, a moment’s
thought should tell you this is all a pack of lies. The price cap is in
US dollars. Russia doesn’t use dollars. It uses Roubles. Russian Taxes
are paid in Roubles. Putin settles payments for his war using Roubles. Oil
and gas in Russia are pulled out of the ground by workers paid in Roubles.

Missiles are not made with dollars. They are made by people working in
factories fabricating and assembling them.

The category mistake is the ongoing belief, instilled by neoliberal
thinking, that governments require tax revenue to spend, even though
Beardsley Ruml, a former chair of the Federal Reserve, [explained back
in the 1940s][3] why that does not and cannot bind a nation. Taxes for
Revenue is and remains an obsolete concept.

## Why it Won’t Work

An individual company will want to export to make a monetary
profit. However, the national economy only needs to export to the
extent that it can obtain imports in exchange for them. Imports raise
a nation’s standard of living. Exports are the cost of obtaining
imports. Exporting in excess is, therefore, potentially a waste of
national resources. Since Russia is barred from obtaining imports from
the West, it has no national interest in exporting anything to the West.

In addition, Russia is banned from dealing in Western currencies, and the
West has banned its populations from dealing in roubles. Paradoxically,
that makes the exchange analysis very easy indeed: nobody in Russia
needs Western currencies as there is nothing to buy with them. However the energy
sales to the West need to be exchanged, at least in part, for roubles as the
Russian energy firms have bills and taxes to pay.

That imbalance should make it very difficult to get hold of roubles in
exchange for Western currencies, and the exchange rate is only being
prevented from ascending into the stratosphere by the [intervention of
the Russian banking system][4].

In effect, Western currencies are confetti from the Russian point of view -
as useless as Reichsmarks. The exchange rate exists to
prop up the energy firms in rouble terms, with the Russian Central Bank
discounting FX settlement balances into roubles as required.

The Russian banking system ensures that the oil companies get enough
Roubles to pay their staff, their suppliers **and the government’s
tax**. This happens whatever the amount of Dollars/Euros/Pounds the energy
firms get in the front door, whether that is one or one billion. The
exchange rate will buffer the problem if the Russian banking system
thinks it needs to.

Moreover, Putin’s government provisions its activities like all
governments provision their activities - by commandeering the resources
of the nation via votes in the legislature. The real tax point is when a
government takes something for its use and deprives the private sector
of access to it, not when money is handed over. Money is just a way of
shifting the burden of that confiscation around the nation.

The government may give the people some roubles for the resources it
commandeers so that they can transact with others. Those others then stand
the loss instead when they settle their tax bill. This way of looking at things is not
a new idea - Keynes laid it out in depth in [How to Pay for the War][5]
in 1940.

All governments of sovereign nations settle payments in the same way -
an interest-free overdraft at the central bank which is then partially
eliminated as taxes are collected, leaving the balance as additional
National Savings in the currency of issue. [In all cases, the underlying
asset the central bank discounts is the state’s power to tax.][6] The
‘missing taxes’, that cause so much wailing and gnashing of teeth,
will turn up, automatically, when the National Savings people hold are
finally withdrawn and spent.

The ‘power to tax’ asset is disguised by the foreign and real assets
the central bank chooses to take onto its books in exchange for issuing
its liabilities, whether that is gold, foreign exchange, IMF claims, or
anything else. An ‘anything else’ that could easily include barrels
of oil.

These masking assets, detectable by not being denominated in the reporting
currency, hide the ‘negative equity’, ‘government overdraft’,
‘ways and means provisions’ or other description of the balancing
item that would otherwise show up on the balance sheet.[^1]

Stripping away these distractions and looking at the underlying processes
shows how things actually work. The Russian government can place orders
for more missiles, pay for them in roubles, allow the tax system to
place the burden of producing those missiles on the Russian people and,
where people decide to save in roubles, mask some of those savings in
the accounts via a notional tax on energy exports.

That process will continue whatever price the West tries to impose on oil
exports and whether Russia decides to send any of its oil abroad or not.

## The Blowback

The impact of the price cap will be felt in the West, not
Russia. Increased uncertainty and risk will raise energy prices across
the board. The oil cartels may not raise production to maintain oil prices
in the usual range. With depleting wells they may not even be able to.

In the meantime, Asia will feast on an energy bounty and further reduce
its cost of production. Is the West sure that Eastern appetite for
consuming fancy logos, snappy advertising jingles and banal lowbrow
entertainment will stay strong enough to allow the West to feed and
power its populations?

Or is our time living high on the hog coming to an end?
